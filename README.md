# What I learned from this lab activity:
- componenet requires to boot up/start up a computer
- function and basic architecture of each componenet 
- how to assemble a computer in correct sequences

# Reflecion
## Obstacle
The sequence to build up each part is vital throughout the whole assemble phase.
## How this lab activity helped me
From this lab activity, I learned the basic architecture and role of each componenet such as CPU, ram, power supply and so on.
